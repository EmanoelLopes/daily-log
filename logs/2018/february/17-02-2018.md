### YEAH! In this month, I am trying to getting deeper in Progressive Web Apps;


## What I readed today:

* [Progressive Web Apps — The Next Step in Web App Development](https://hackernoon.com/progressive-web-apps-the-next-step-in-web-app-development-372235bf9a99)

* [Progressive Web Apps - Google Developers](https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/)

## Courses I'am doing right now:

* [Progressive Web Apps (PWA) - The Complete Guide](https://www.udemy.com/progressive-web-app-pwa-the-complete-guide/) - This course is strongly recomended, one of the best sources.
